# belly-button-challenge

In this project, I built an interactive dashboard that explores a belly button biodiversity dataset. This dataset catalogs microbes that live in human navals. In this assignment I used d3 code in visual code studio to create an app on a webpage. This app contains information and graphs based on a a sample dataset. 

To look at my d3 code, the file app.js in the static folder contains my code. The sample data I used is in the sample.json file located in the Starter_code folder. To find my app, open the index.html file located in the Starter_Code folder.
